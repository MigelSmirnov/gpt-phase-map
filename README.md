# gpt-phase-map
Interactive phase-map visualization of GPT behavior built with Python and Bokeh. Each point encodes direction, angle and regime text. The UI supports axis-based filtering: only active-axis points remain fully interactive, while others fade into the background. Useful for exploring and analyzing model behavior patterns.
